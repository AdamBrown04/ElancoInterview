/*
what I wanted to do here was to output each city for a country and its population to show 
how the population of a country is distributed among its cities. However, with the current API
that is not possible due to the fact that the API only has a very limited amount of information
about population of cities within a country (some major countries don't have their capaitals listed).
This would of functioned very similarly to getPopulationData() and generatePopulationTable() in main.js
on how it would collect the data from the API and then display it on the page in a table.
